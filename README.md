# Peakipy - NMR peak integration/deconvolution using python

## Description

Simple deconvolution of NMR peaks for extraction of intensities. Provided an NMRPipe format spectrum (2D or Pseudo 3D) and a peak list (NMRPipe, Sparky or Analysis2), overlapped peaks are automatically/interactively clustered and groups of overlapped peaks are fitted together using Gaussian, Lorentzian or Pseudo-Voigt (Gaussian + Lorentzian).

## Installation

With poetry...

```bash
cd peakipy; poetry install
```

If you don't have poetry you can install it with pip

```bash
pip install poetry
```

With setup.py you will need python3.6 or greater installed.

```bash
cd peakipy; python setup.py install
```

At this point the package is installed and the main scripts (`read_peaklist.py`, `run_check_fits.py` and `fit_peaks.py`)
should have been added to your path.

## Inputs

1. Peaklist (see below for specification)
2. NMRPipe frequency domain dataset (Pseudo 3D)

There are three main scripts.

1. `read_peaklist.py` is used to convert peak list and select clusters peaks.
2. `run_check_fits.py` is used to check and adjust fit parameters interactively (i.e clusters and mask radii) if initial clustering is not satisfactory.
3. `fit_peaks.py` is used to fit clusters of peaks

Use the `-h` or `--help` flags for instructions on how to run the programs.

### Peaklists

First you need a peak list either Sparky, Analysis2 or NMRPipe format.

#### Anslysis2 peaklist

Example of tab delimted peaklist exported directly from Analysis2

```bash
Number  #       Position F1     Position F2     Sampled None    Assign F1       Assign F2       Assign F3       Height  Volume  Line Width F1 (Hz)  Line Width F2 (Hz)      Line Width F3 (Hz)      Merit   Details Fit Method      Vol. Method
1       1       9.33585 129.67323       2.00000  {23}H[45]       {23}N[46]       2.0    3.91116e+07     2.14891e+08     15.34578        19.24590    None    1.00000 None    parabolic       box sum

```

#### Sparky peaklist

Minimum

```bash
Assignment  w1  w2
PeakOne 118 7.5
PeakTwo 119 7.4
etc...

```

Also accepted...

```bash
Assignment  w1  w2  
PeakOne 118 7.5
PeakTwo 119 7.4
etc...

```

#### NMRPipe peaklist

Default peaklist generated by NMRDraw (e.g. test.tab)


### Running read_peaklist.py

Here is an example of how to run read_peaklist.py

```bash
read_peaklist.py peaks.sparky test.ft2 --sparky --show --outfmt=csv
```

This will convert your peaklist to into a `pandas DataFrame` and use `threshold_otsu` from `scikit-image` to determine a cutoff for selecting overlapping peaks.
These are subsequently grouped into clusters ("CLUSTID" column a la NMRPipe!)

![Clustered peaks](images/clusters.png)

The threshhold level can be adjusted with the `--thres` option like so

```bash
read_peaklist.py peaks.sparky test.ft2 --sparky --show --outfmt=csv --thres=1e6
```

Clustered peaks are colour coded. Singlet peaks are black. If you want to edit this after running `read_peaklist.py` then you can edit `show_clusters.yml` and re-plot using `spec.py show_clusters.yml`

```bash
read_peaklist.py peaks.sparky test.ft2 --dims=0,1,2 --show --outfmt=csv
```

If the automatic clustering is not satisfactory you can manually adjust clusters and fitting start parameters using `run_check_fits.py`.

```bash
run_check_fits.py <peaklist> <nmrdata>
```

![Using run_check_fits.py](images/bokeh.png)

Select the cluster you are interested in using the table and double click to edit the cluster numbers. Once a set of peaks is selected you can manually adjust their starting parameters for fitting (including the X and Y radii for the fitting mask)

## Protocol

Initial parameters for FWHM,  



## Outputs

1. Pandas DataFrame containing fitted intensities/linewidths/centers etc.
2. If `--plot=<path>` option selected the first plane of each fit will be plotted in <path> with the files named according to the cluster ID (CLUSTID) of the fit. Adding `--show` option calls `plt.show()` on each fit so you can see what it looks like.


## Pseudo-Voigt model

Where Gaussian lineshape is

And Lorentzian is

![L](images/equations/L.tex.png)

The fit minimises the residuals of the functions in each dimension

Fraction parameter is fraction of Lorentzian lineshape.

The linewidth for a Gaussian is

## Comparison with NMRPipe


## Homage to FuDA

If you would rather use FuDA then try running `read_peaklist.py` with the `--fuda` flag to create a FuDA parameter file and peak list. 
This should ouput a params.fuda file and hopefully save you some time on
configuration.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Jonathan Helmus for writing the wonderful `nmrglue` package.
The `lmfit` team for their awesome work.
`Bokeh` and `Matplotlib` for beautiful plotting.
`Scikit-image`!

My colleagues, Rui Huang, Alex Conicella, Enrico Rennella and Rob Harkness for they extremely helpful input.


## To do

1. Add function to read_peaklist.py that allows output to FuDA format parameter file

2. add flag to include vclist to output dataframe

3. Normalize peaks

4. Multiprocessor

5. Script to check fits and add column with x_radius and y_radius so that you can edit the parameters and rerun specific fits.
