# Peak deconvolution

## Description

Simple deconvolution of NMR peaks for extraction of intensities. Provided an NMRPipe format spectrum (2D or Pseudo 3D) and a peak list (NMRPipe, Sparky or Analysis2), overlapped peaks are automatically/interactively clustered and groups of overlapped peaks are fitted together using Gaussian, Lorentzian or Pseudo-Voigt (Gaussian + Lorentzian).

## Installation

With poetry...

```bash
cd peak_deconvolution; poetry install
```

With setup.py you will need python3.6 or greater installed.

```bash
cd peak_deconvolution; python setup.py install
```

## Inputs

There are two main steps to running this program.

1. read_peaklist.py is used to convert peak list and select clusters peaks.
2. fit_pipe_peaks.py is used to fit clusters of peaks


### Running read_peaklist.py

First you need a peak list either Sparky or Analysis2 format.

Here is an example of how to run read_peaklist.py

```bash
read_peaklist.py peaks.sparky test.ft2 --noise=5e4 --pthres=1.75e6 --dims=0,1,2 --show --outfmt=csv
```




##Â Protocol

Initial parameters for FWHM,  



## Outputs

1. Pandas DataFrame containing fitted intensities/linewidths/centers etc.
2. If --plot=<path> option selected the first plane of each fit will be plotted in <path> with the files named according to the cluster ID (CLUSTID) of the fit.


## Pseudo-Voigt model

Fraction parameter is fraction of Lorentzian lineshape.


## To do

1. Add function to read_peaklist.py that allows output to FuDA format parameter file

2. add flag to include vclist to output dataframe

3. Normalize peaks
