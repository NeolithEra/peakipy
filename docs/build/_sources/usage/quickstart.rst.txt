Quickstart instructions
=======================

Inputs
------

1. Peak list (see :doc:`instructions`)
2. NMRPipe frequency domain dataset (2D or Pseudo 3D)

There are four main scripts.

1. ``read_peaklist`` converts your peak list and selects clusters of peaks.
2. ``edit_fits`` is used to check and adjust fit parameters interactively (i.e clusters and mask radii) if initial clustering is not satisfactory.
3. ``fit_peaks`` fits clusters of peaks.
4. ``check_fits`` is used to check individual fits or groups of fits and make plots.

Head to the :doc:`instructions` section for a description of how to run these scripts.
You can also use the ``-h`` or ``--help`` flags for instructions on how to run the programs.
